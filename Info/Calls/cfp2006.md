Special Session

We encourage the submission of papers to be presented in a special session at June 8th. In this session we would like to bring together all relevant recent research and know-how concerned by the violin family and related musical digital interfaces.

The purpose of this special session is to create an opportunity for in-depth discussions on a topic of wide-ranging interest to several of the NIME themes. Papers for the special session will be subject to the same review process as the other submissions.

Demos

Although brief demonstrations can be shown during paper sessions, NIME 06 will give the possibility to schedule demo presentations in dedicated demo sessions. The submission procedure will allow to choose an explicit demo option for any paper or poster submission.
The simplest demo submission would take the form of a short poster summarizing the scientific/technical aspects, acquired experiences and/or the context of the development.

For presentations of commercial products and companies not associated
with a conference submission, there will be exhibit booths.
Please contact Vincent.Puig[at]ircam[fr].

LIVE PERFORMANCES

An evening concert during the conference will be dedicated to live performances hilighting creative use of interactive instrument technology.

We welcome proposals for performances to be featured in the NIME 06
concert.

Please refer to the NIME 06 web page for detailed submission guidelines.

INTERACTIVE INSTALLATIONS

Various spaces in and around the conference venue are reserved for interactive sound and multimedia installations.

We welcome proposals for interactive installations to be presented
during the conference. We particularly encourage installations that could run during the entire period of Agora/RÃ©sonances from June 1 to June 17.

While some of the spaces are closed rooms, others are open spaces such as entrance or stairs which encourage site-specific installations.
Please refer to the NIME 06 web page for detailed submission guidelines and descriptions of the provided installation spaces.
