## After the conference

### Report to the SC

The conference organizer should at the end of the conference prepare an evaluation report for the steering committee. This evaluation report is mainly going to discuss various issues that can be valuable for future organizers. This may include:

* practical matters:
** economy
** web page
** conference management system

* content:
** paper/music selection
** conference profile

The most important is to understand what went well, and what can be improved.
