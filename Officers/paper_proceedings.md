# Paper proceedings archive officer

Main roles:

1. Archive the proceedings on nime.org and Zenodo
2. Index the papers in DBLP, ACM DL, Scopus, and others

The paper proceedings archive officer will work closely with each year's [Paper Chair](../Chairs/paper_chair.md).

## General info about the proceedings

### Name of the proceedings

Before 2011 the proceedings title (often) also included the location and/or the date of the conference. This is no longer possible with the ISSN numbers, so then the location and date should be listed in a subheader, e.g.:

   Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
   30 May - 1 June 2011, Oslo, Norway

### ISSN

From 2011 we acquired ISSN numbers for the NIME proceedings. Since ISSN registers publication series, they also require that the title of each publication stays the same. We currently have 3 ISSN numbers, for different publication types:

* Print: ISSN 2220-4792 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
* Online: ISSN 2220-4806 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
* CD-ROM/USB: ISSN 2220-4814 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression

### ISBN

It is possible (and advisable) to also acquire ISBN numbers for the proceedings. This can usually be done through the library of the host institution, which probably already has a range of possible ISBN numbers to choose from. There is no problem having both ISBN and ISSN numbers for the same publication. The ISSN number represents the conference series, while the ISBN number represents the specific publication.


## Upload to Zenodo

NIME has decided to use Zenodo for archival of papers.


## Indexing

Indexing of the proceedings is important for the visibility of the papers. We will work more on improving this in the future.

### Indexing in Google Scholar

The [papercite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/papercite/) plugin used on nime.org contains metadata information that is indexed by Google Scholar. So nothing else should be needed than getting the papers on nime.org.

It may be worth checking the latest [Google description](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html) on how to make a cite searchable for indexing in Scholar.


### Indexing in DBLP

For several years NIME was indeded in [DBLP](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/nime/index.html). However, after they changed their submission format, we never managed to back on track.

Here is [info](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/How+can+I+submit+meta+data+for+a+complete+journal+or+conference.html) on how to submit to DBLP.

### Indexing in ACM

The same is true for ACM, with which we have not been able to index for several years either. This is important to work on, hence the need for someone to work on this in particular.

### Scopus

A request to register NIME in Scopus ([Engineering Village](https://suggestor.ei.engineeringvillage.com/faq/index)) was sent in June 2018. They have a long processing time, and we got a reply in June 2019 saying:  

> Please be advised that the decision was made to accept this title in Compendex.
>
> If necessary, our Source Collection Management department will contact the publisher in order to set up the content feed for Compendex. The title will be loaded in Compendex as soon as we have access to the title and the content has been processed for indexing. At this moment, there is no further action required from your end.

> Regards,

> EV Title Suggestion Team

Will have to wait and see how this turns out.
