# Web page officer

Main task: Keep the nime.org domain running, and continue to develop the web page.

Action points:

1. Move web pages to a new platform (the current Wordpress install is too vulnreable)
2. Move the domain to new solution(s)
3. Consider further developments

Officers:

- Charles Martin
- Rodrigo Schramm


## Content on nime.org

The web page currently has these functions:

1. General information about the community and links to annual conferences.
2. Proceedings archive
3. (Partly) archive of annual conference web pages

There have been discussions about developing the community page further, for example with:

- A web forum, possibly connected to one or more mailing lists
- A news/blog section
- A directory of active NIME'rs and institutions

Considering recent social media developments, the two first may not be so relevant any longer. A directory could be useful, however, but needs maintenance if developed.

## Web platform

The current page is hosted on Wordpress. One option may be a jekyll-based solution on github.

Some things to consider:

- we are currently using the papercite plugin to [generate the paper archive](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/officers/paper_proceedings#indexing-in-google-scholar), so it is critical to find another solution for this if we move away from wordpress.
- need to figure out where to archive old conference web pages (static pages with own formatting)
