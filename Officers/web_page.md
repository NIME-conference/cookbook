# Web page officer

Main task: Keep the nime.org domain running, and continue to develop the web page.

## Content on nime.org

The web page currently has these functions:

1. General information about the community and links to annual conferences.
2. Proceedings archive
3. (Partly) archive of annual conference web pages

There have been discussions about developing the community page further, for example with:

- A web forum, possibly connected to one or more mailing lists
- A news/blog section
- A directory of active NIME'rs and institutions

## Web platform

- Jekyll website with development on Github
- Deployed via GitHub action to a shared hosting provider.
- Static web content will all be composed in markdown
- Proceedings files are pulled in YAML format from the NIME Bibliography repository and processed by Jekyll into appropriate listings.

#### Website archive

- Archived NIME websites are retrieved by the web officer / proceedings chair and archived on our shared hosting provider.
- Ideally a backup of each website is stored on github.

#### Costs of Hosting

- Currently hosting costs are owned by the web officer which is annoying but bearable.
- Ideally there would be a solution to have the community support these costs.
