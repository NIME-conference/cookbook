# Web page officer

Main task: Keep the nime.org domain running, and continue to develop the web page.

Action points:

1. Move web pages to a new platform (the current Wordpress install is too vulnreable)
2. Move the domain to new solution(s)
3. Consider further developments

## Content on nime.org

The web page currently has these functions:

1. General information about the community and links to annual conferences.
2. Proceedings archive
3. (Partly) archive of annual conference web pages

There have been discussions about developing the community page further, for example with:

- A web forum, possibly connected to one or more mailing lists
- A news/blog section
- A directory of active NIME'rs and institutions

Considering recent social media developments, the two first may not be so relevant any longer. A directory could be useful, however, but needs maintenance if developed.
