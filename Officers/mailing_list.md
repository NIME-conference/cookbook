## More info about the mailing list

The [NIME mailing list](http://www.nime.org/mailing-list/) mailing list officers maintain the mailing lists of the community, and in particular the community@-list.

## Hosting

The list is currently hosted on googlegroups.  List admins can access [group management settings](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!groupsettings/nime-community/information), but these are rarely changed. Be cautious!


## Admin Tasks

There are two main tasks for list admin officers: moderating posts to the list and responding to sign-up requests.  

### Moderating Posts

As a list admin you will receive an email advising that someone has posted to the list. These should be self-explanatory and non-controversial posts can simply be approved by the first list admin to see the email.

Pending posts can also be seen [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!pendingmsg/nime-community).

Where there is doubt about a particular post, list admins may need to briefly discuss to decide whether to approve, request changes or reject.  The [posting policy](#posting-policy) is strictly applied.

### Sign up Requests

For some reason Google Groups no longer notifies list admins of sign up requests. It is recommended that list admins regularly check for [join requests](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!pendingmember/nime-community/apply) and approve as appropriate.  To date we have not had a problem with spammy subscriptions so unless there is an obvious issue join requests are routinely approved.


## Posting policy

Posts to the list should be restricted to calls for papers/works, job announcements, and topics of specific interest to the NIME community.

Except where specifically relevant to a large proportion of the NIME community, posts regarding products, software and concert performances should not be posted.
