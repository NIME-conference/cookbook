# Paper template officer

Main goal: Develop a new NIME paper template solution (preferably media-rich)


## Requirements

1. Needs to be media-rich
2. Should be possible to use also for non-techy NIMErs (those that prefer the MS Word template today). Thus may need to think of the template as a tool
3. Needs to be fairly longterm (we cannot change template every year)
4. Needs to be archivable in Zenodo
5. Should embrace principles of Open Research: sharability, reproducibility, etc.

## Some questions

- Do we want to provide a hosting solution?  
- What type of media should we go for?
- What about metadata, thinking about indexing, etc.
- Do we need documents that can be printed (as PDF)?
