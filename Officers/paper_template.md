# Paper template officer

Main goal: Be in charge of the paper template for the NIME conferences

Tasks:

- Check templates of other conferences and publishing solutions
- Develop and prototype a new NIME paper template solution (preferably media-rich)
- Test the prototype template on a user group
- Work with 2020 organisers on making a decision for 2020

Officers:

- Charlie Roberts
- Niccolo Granieri
- Jack Armitage
- Luiz Naveda


## Background

NIME has been using an ACM paper template from the start, and it is time to look for something better. This has been discussed at multiple conferences:

- NIME 2016 (Brisbane): Workshop on
- NIME 2019 (Porto Alegre): Open NIME workshop


## Requirements

1. Needs to be media-rich
2. Should be possible to use also for non-techy NIMErs (those that prefer the MS Word template today). Thus may need to think of the template as a tool
3. Needs to be fairly longterm (we cannot change template every year)
4. Needs to be archivable in Zenodo
5. Should embrace principles of Open Research: sharability, reproducibility, etc.
6. Needs to work for peer review (currently double-blind)

## Some questions

- Do we want to provide a hosting solution? Who should maintain/pay for the solution?
- What type of media should we open for including?
- How would embedding code work in a longterm perspective?
- What about metadata, thinking about indexing, etc.
- Do we need documents that can be printed (as PDF)?
- Can we open for integrated peer reviewing processes (Authorea-style)?
