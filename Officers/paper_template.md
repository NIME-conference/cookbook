# Paper template officer

Main goal: Be in charge of the paper template for the NIME conferences

Tasks:

- Check templates of other conferences and publishing solutions
- Develop and prototype a new NIME paper template solution (preferably media-rich)
- Test the prototype template on a user group
- Work with 2020 organisers on making a decision for 2020

Officers:

- Charlie Roberts
- Niccolo Granieri
- Jack Armitage
- Luiz Naveda
- Charles Martin


## Background

NIME has been using an ACM paper template from the start, and it is time to look for something better. This has been discussed at multiple conferences:

- NIME 2016 (Brisbane): Workshop on
- NIME 2019 (Porto Alegre): Open NIME workshop


## Requirements

1. Needs to be media-rich
2. Should be possible to use also for non-techy NIMErs (those that prefer the MS Word template today). Thus we may need to think of the tools to be used to create submissions
3. Needs to be fairly longterm (we cannot change template every year)
4. Needs to be archivable in Zenodo
5. Should embrace principles of Open Research: sharability, reproducibility, etc.
6. Needs to work for peer review (currently double-blind)
7. Needs to be cross-platform and standards-based
8. Should be checked for accessibility (fonts, etc.)

## Some questions

- Do we want to provide a hosting solution? Who should maintain/pay for the solution?
- What type of media should we open for including?
- How would embedding code work in a longterm perspective?
- What about metadata, thinking about indexing, etc.
- Do we need documents that can be printed (as PDF)?
- Can we open for integrated peer reviewing processes (Authorea-style)?
- Can we open for translations to other languages than English (Wikipedia-style)?
- Can we open for "lean publishing"?
- How do we think about "number of pages"? Word count as limit?
- How can we allow for version control and DOIs?


### Items to include in template

Should we have mandatory fields in the template for:

- Data Availability Statement
- Ethics Statement
- Author Contributions
- Funding
- Conflict of Interest
- Acknowledgments
