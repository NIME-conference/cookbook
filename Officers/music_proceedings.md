# Music proceedings archive officer

Main goal: Build up and maintain a music proceedings archive for NIME, including recordings of performances.

Officers:

- Federico Visi
- Ico Bukvic
- Niccolo Granieri
- Christopher Walker

## Background

NIME has never had a proper handling of the artistic contributions. Usually the music proceedings has been a program booklet with information about pieces, composers and performers.

Most performances at NIME have been recorded, but they have only occasionally been made available, such as from [NIME 2011](https://vimeo.com/channels/nime2011/videos). There are two main reasons for the lack of availability:

1. Time and human resources for editing recorded content after the conference
2. Legal issues, related to privacy (of audience members) and copyright issues (pieces and performers)

For NIME 2019 a separate music proceedings booklet was made, with extended music abstracts. These extended abstracts and their bibliograpnic information are available in the [Music page of the NIME website](https://www.nime.org/music/).

In 2019, the Steering Committee has endorsed building up a proper NIME music proceedings archive using the [COMPEL](http://ico.bukvic.net/main/compel/) platform.


## Some issues to consider

- Need to consider both medium and longterm archiving.
- Need to have dialogue with the [Paper Archive](paper_proceedings.md) and [Paper Template](paper_template.md) officers.
