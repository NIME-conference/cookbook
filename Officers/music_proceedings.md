# Music proceedings archive officer

Main goal: Build up and maintain a music proceedings archive for NIME, including recordings of performances.

Officers:

- Federico Visi
- Ico Bukvic
- Niccolo Granieri
- Christopher Walker

## Background

NIME has never had a proper handling of the artistic contributions. Usually the music proceedings has been a program booklet with information about pieces, composers and performers.

Most performances at NIME have been recorded, but they have only occasionally been made available, such as from [NIME 2011](https://vimeo.com/channels/nime2011/videos). There are two main reasons for the lack of availability:

1. Time and human resources for editing recorded content after the conference
2. Legal issues, related to privacy (of audience members) and copyright issues (pieces and performers)

For NIME 2019 a separate music proceedings booklet was made, with extended music abstracts. These extended abstracts and their bibliograpnic information are available in the [Music page of the NIME website](https://www.nime.org/music/).

In 2019, the Steering Committee has endorsed building up a proper NIME music proceedings archive using the [COMPEL](http://ico.bukvic.net/main/compel/) platform.

### NIME 2019 Music Proceedings Template and Instructions

The following template and instructions were sent to the accepted Music submissions in 2019.

> We would like to offer you the opportunity of publishing your Music  
> proposal as an extended abstract, which will be included in the Music  
> Proceedings of NIMEâ€™19.  
>   
> This is an experimental initiative that will be presented this year for  
> the first time in NIME history. We believe practice work is an integral  
> part of NIME, and we see this as a first step towards a better and more  
> consistent way of documenting the pieces presented at the conference every  
> year.  
>   
> Having your proposal made freely available as an extended abstract in the  
> Music Proceedings will give other scholars and practitioners a useful  
> resource for their research, making it easier for them to retrieve your  
> work and cite it in their publications.  
>   
> If the NIME community responds well to this proposal and we receive enough  
> extended abstracts, each work will be assigned unique DOI and will be made  
> freely available online through the NIME website.  
>   
> Please download the Music Proceedings extended abstract template using  
> this link:  
>   
> https://www.dropbox.com/s/exn7asi6vfeumdi/NIME19_Music_Proceedings_Template.docx.zip?dl=0  
>   
> The length of your abstract should be maximum 4 pages, and should include  
> the following sections (as shown in the template):  
> Project Description  
> Technical Notes  
> Program Notes  
> Media Link(s)  
> Acknowledgements (optional)  
> References (optional)  
>   
> We encourage you to add bibliographic references, particularly if there  
> are published papers describing your NIME more in detail.  
> If the anonymous reviewers made remarks that can be addressed in your  
> extended abstract (e.g. they pointed out previous relevant work) we  
> encourage you to take their comments into consideration.  
>   
> Please edit your extended abstract using the Music Proceedings extended  
> abstract template and upload it on your submission page as an editable file  
> by April 10th. The file will go through a short internal review and you may  
> be asked to do some minor amendments if needed. Do not hesitate to contact  
> us should you have any question.  
>   
> This is a first, small step towards making practice work even more  
> important for NIME research, and we are very excited about it. We hope you  
> will accept this proposal with enthusiasm and we look forward to receiving  
> your extended abstract.  

## Template

In 2019 and 2020 we used an adapted version of the ACM Extended Abstract template:
- [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt)
- [Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx)

## Some issues to consider

- Need to consider both medium and longterm archiving.
- Need to have dialogue with the [Paper Archive](paper_proceedings.md) and [Paper Template](paper_template.md) officers.
