## Pamela Z Award for Innovation

A successful workshop on diversity was held at NIME 2018 at Virginia Tech initiated by Astrid Bin, Anna Weisling and Sarah Schoemann from Women in Music Tech at Georgia Tech. The Pamela Z Award for Innovation was born out of this conversation about gender diversity and
intends to recognise researchers who are positively contributing to diversity in the NIME community.

This award recognizes a person who is doing significant work that improves the discussion about diversity in NIME - either through their research, connecting people or through actions such as organisation and awareness. It was named after Pamela Z because she was a keynote in the founding year, because she is a pioneer in this field and an extraordinary artist, and because spending time each NIME thinking about an award named after a prolific African American woman is a way of continually highlighting the value of her work, and representing voices that are often invisible in the community.
