# Paper Chair


## Before the conference

### Peer review

* The paper chair(s) assign papers to reviewers (3-4 per paper to get enough) and follow up the deadlines
* A group of meta-reviewers write the summaries and suggest acceptance
* The paper chair(s) do the final selection

In the interest of running the process as smoothly as possible, the paper chair(s) should do the review assignment and follow-up. This is how it has always been (we only started with meta-reviewers in 2014). The CMS helps out a lot by coming up with suggestions of reviewers based on expertise. Having a centralized reviewer assignment also helps in avoiding individuals to be contacted by multiple meta-reviewers.

## A few tips ##

* When it comes to reviewers, you can get lists from previous chairs (or it may be in the system). It is common to add some local people each year, and some of these should probably be removed if they are not regular NIMErs.

* Be careful about accepting to take on reviewers that start out saying they have little time, and can do the reviews a bit late. If people first start being late, they may be vary late, or not deliver at all. It is a very tight

* Be very strict about deadlines, and plan well ahead. The reviewer pool should be ready way before the deadline, preferably before Christmas. It is better to get too many than too few.

* Prepare reviewers and meta-reviewers about what is coming when. So a week before they should get to action, you can send them an e-mail and inform them about when they will receive their assignments.


## Confirmation letter to send ##

After paper reviewing there are different kinds of letter to send:
* submitted and accepted as paper
* submitted as paper but downgraded to poster
* submitted as poster and accepted as such
* submitted as concert but performed as club
* submitted as concert but downgraded to demo

#### Double-blindedness

This is how double-blind policy is implemented in the PCS System used at NIME:

1. authors do not know external reviewer nor meta-reviewer names   
2. external reviewers do not know author names   
3. meta-reviewers know both author and external reviewer names  
4.  external reviewers do not know other external reviewer names   
5. external reviewers know meta-reviewer names

The only strictly double-blind part is that between external reviewers and authors.



## During the conference

### Presentation duration

Previously there was a difference in presentation time between short and long papers. That has changed, and all presentations are equally long:

* 15 min presentation + 3 min questions + 2 min turnover

Please ask the next presenters to start preparing during the Q&A to save time.
