# Town Hall Meeting

The NIME Town Hall meeting is held after the last paper session of the conference.

The meeting serves several purposes:

* General information from the steering committee
* Thank you to the organizers and staff
* Open evaluation and discussion
* Introduction of next year's organizer

The meeting typically lasts for an hour and is led by the chair of the Steering Committee


## Evaluation

To help write up the evaluation report, it may be useful to ask the participants to fill out a written evaluation form in addition to an oral evaluation.




The following questions were uesd in the evaluation form from NIME 2011.

### 1. General questions

1. Was this your first NIME conference?
2. Did you present anything at the conference?
3. What do you think about the conference in general?
4. What do you think worked well?
5. What could have been improved?

### 2. Specific questions (if you have time/interest)

1. What do you think about the information you received before and under the conference? Was it too much, too little, too late, etc...

2. What do you think about the venues and access? Did you find the venues easily? Do you think they were too far away from each other? Would you have preferred to go to club concerts at smaller clubs around the city rather than having all concerts located in adjacent venues?

3. What do you think about doing peer review of artistic submissions? For NIME 2011 all performance submissions went through a single-blind peer review process by international experts. This is not so common, so we are interested in hearing your opinion on whether this is something to continue with in the future.

4. Should NIME be affiliated with an organization? The NIME conferences have been organized quite loosely up until now. Do you think it would be better if NIME conferences were affiliated with an organization, like ACM or IEEE?

5. If yes, what type of organizational structure do you prefer? ACM, IEEE, something else? Or do you think NIME should be established as a separate assocation / foundation / society?

6. Where do you currently publish your work? Which conferences and journals?

7. Would you be interested in publishing in a NIME journal? The steering committee has been talking about the need for a journal for NIME and related topics. Is this something you would be interested in?


## Awards

Awards have always been a difficult question at NIME. On one side, the SC wants the conference to be an inclusive event, in which the main aim is to share and discuss. Then awards may be seen as an unwanted, competitive element. On the other side, there is also an understanding that many other conferences and fields have awards. Thus having awards may help to inspire some and promote the careers of participants.

The SC does not have a policy on awards for papers, posters, etc, and let the local chairs decide on if and how they want to create awards.

The only award that the SC actively promotes, is the [Pamela Z Award for Innovation](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/officers/winime#pamela-z-award-for-innovation).
