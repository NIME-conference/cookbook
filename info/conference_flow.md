# Flow of the Conference

## NIME's DNA

- NIME is a friendly conference. It is important that it is equally welcoming to people from both academic and artistic backgrounds, and to both newcomers and longtimers.
- NIME should feel like a "small" conference, even though it is quite large. One way of achieving this is the single-track paper sessions, which ensures that everyone experiences the same content. Presentations are short (10-15 minutes) and of high quality.
- Poster and demo sessions are very important at NIME. This is where you can try things yourself. Paper presenters are encouraged to also set up a demo (if relevant).  
- The artistic program is equally important as the scientific, and should be peer reviewed and presented on similar terms.

## General Schedule

The typical structure of a NIME conference is three days of core conference activities. It is common to organize a day of workshops prior to the conference, and one or more "unconference" activities the day after the main program. Installations typically run through the whole conference, and often also before and after.

## Things to consider

### Banquet

There have been a banquet at several NIMEs, but not all. If you decide to hold a banquet, please consider the cost. It is unfortunate if many participants are not able to participate due to a high price tag.
