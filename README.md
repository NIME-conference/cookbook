# NIME Conference Cookbook

[This online book](https://nime-conference.github.io/cookbook/) is a semi-public working document for the organization of the [NIME conference](http://www.nime.org) series. It is split into a [general](https://nime-conference.github.io/cookbook/info) section, a section for the [chairs](https://nime-conference.github.io/cookbook/chairs) of the annual conferences, and another for the [officers](https://nime-conference.github.io/cookbook/officers/) responsible for the general operations of the community.

The cookbook is hosted on GitHub Pages at this location: <https://nime-conference.github.io/cookbook/>

The source can be found and edited in this GitHub Repository: <https://github.com/NIME-conference/cookbook/>

If you want comment on anything or get write access to the Cookbook, please get in touch with the [chair of the Steering Committee](http://people.uio.no/alexanje).
