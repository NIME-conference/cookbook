# NIME Conference Cookbook

[This book](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/) is a semi-public working document for the organization of the [NIME conference](http://www.nime.org) series. It is split into a section for the [chairs](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/chairs) of the annual conferences, and another for the [officers](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/officers/) responsible for the general operations of the community.

If you want comment on anything or get write access to the Cookbook, please get in touch with the [chair of the SC](http://people.uio.no/alexanje).
