# About the Proceedings


## Name of the proceedings ##

Before 2011 the proceedings title (often) also included the location and/or the date of the conference. This is no longer possible with the ISSN numbers, so then the location and date should be listed in a subheader, e.g.:

   Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
   30 May - 1 June 2011, Oslo, Norway

## ISSN ##

From 2011 we acquired ISSN numbers for the NIME proceedings. Since ISSN registers publication series, they also require that the title of each publication stays the same. We currently have 3 ISSN numbers, for different publication types:

* Print: ISSN 2220-4792 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
* Online: ISSN 2220-4806 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression
* CD-ROM/USB: ISSN 2220-4814 = Proceedings of the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression

## ISBN ##

It is possible (and advisable) to also acquire ISBN numbers for the proceedings. This can usually be done through the library of the host institution, which probably already has a range of possible ISBN numbers to choose from. There is no problem having both ISBN and ISSN numbers for the same publication. The ISSN number represents the conference series, while the ISBN number represents the specific publication.

## Printing the proceedings ##

Remember to check the PDF file properly before sending to the printer. It is also advisable to get a full test print to check for any mistakes. Professional printers may have problems with characters and formatting that regular home/office printers print beautifully.
