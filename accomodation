## Price level

Many NIME participants are travelling on a budget, so it would be good to come up with suggested accommodation alternatives in the lower price end. This can include anything from university student housing to cheap hotels.

## Accomodation discussions

To allow participants to suggest accommodation and/or to contact each other about sharing apartments, etc., it may be useful to set up some kind of e-mail list or web forum (e.g. on Facebook). It is better to leave the NIME.org mailing list for general announcements.
