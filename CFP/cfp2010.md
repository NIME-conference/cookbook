ANNOUNCEMENT: CALL FOR PAPER SUBMISSIONS<br>NIME Conference<br>7-11 June 2010<br>Sydney, Australia<br>Submission deadline: 29 January 2010 

http://www.educ.dab.uts.edu.au/nime/submission.php 

Could you please circulate this call for papers to your colleagues, students, friends? 

NIME is taking on an expanded definition in 2010. New Interfaces for Musical Expression is being considered in an interdisciplinary light, emphasising the expression part of interface, instrument and performance design, as well as its obvious links to multimodal creativity and design, practice-based research, HCI and sound and music in urban, product, spatial, information display and broader performative contexts. We look forward to a lively dialogue with colleagues at the intersection of modalities. 

We have been enthusiastic about the inventiveness and commitment of the NIME community over the years but we also feel that a healthy dialogue awaits at the nexus with ICAD, CCS, DCC, HCI/CHI, INTERACT communities too as our research is increasingly interactive and interdisciplinary these days, permeating many design and creative disciplines. 

Shortly to follow the paper call will be calls for performance, installation, workshop and tutorial proposals. This year, academic workshops on specialist areas based around presentations and discussion will co-exist with hands-on making and pedagogical sessions (we are calling these tutorials). 

Many thanks,<br>Kirsty<br>(co-chair)
