This is a brief overview of the basics of hosting a NIME conference. 

## Name of the conference

The official name of the NIME conference is "International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression". The title can be followed by the year, but this should not be used as part of the conference title itself. 

Abbreviated, the conference is called NIME followed by the year of the conference, for example: NIME2008. 


## Time of the conference

NIME has traditionally been organised in the end of May or beginning of June. There have been a few exceptions to this rule, but it is preferable to stay with the May/June timing for consistency and for avoiding crashes with other conferences. 


## Location of the conference

NIME is proud of being a truly international conference. To ensure this, it moves between continents every year. Up until now it has been moving between Europe, North America, and the rest of the world every third year. This pattern is not entirely fixed, but it is highly encouraged to avoid staying in one continent, or just moving between Europe and North America. 

## Eligible Host Organization

There is not a particular requirement for the type of host institution. NIME is typically organised by universities or music academies/conservatories, or a combination of such higher education institutions and cultural organizations. 


## Language of the conference

The official language of the conference is English.


## Economy of the conference

NIME is not a formal organization, and has no means on its own. It can be seen as a network of individually organized conferences.


Each Host Organization is economically responsible for their own conference. It may freely solicit any
and all public and private funding organizations, institutions, sponsors
and partners in any country. It also has the right to set registration
fees and costs as needed to cover production of event and publication of
proceedings. 

## Registration fees 

NIME draws participants from academic institutions, both faculty and students, but also freelance artists, industry people, etc. 
It is important to keep the registration fees as low as possible, but as high as necessary. 

It is particularly important to have measures in place to secure that students, and independent researchers/artists are able to participate. 

This could be based on reduced registration fees, scholarships, volunteer programmes, or a combination of these. 

The conference fees should not change dramatically from one year to another. 


## Conference program

The conference program is based on the results of an international Call for Participation, with the following categories: 

- Papers (oral and poster)
- Demos
- Performance
- Installation
- Workshops

There should be assigned on chair for each category, who is responsible for organizing the peer review of their track.

In addition to the peer reviewed conference program, the Host Organization is encouraged to include invited speakers, performers, exhibitors, etc. in the program if possible.

It is particuarly relevant to use the opportunity to invite people that would not otherwise come to NIME, such as to broaden the perspectives of the community. This also includes incorporating aspects of local culture, history and traditions (as they pertain to
music, arts and technology) to make every Conference a unique and rewarding socio-cultural experience.

## Cultural Diversity

It is NIMEâ€™s goal to develop
