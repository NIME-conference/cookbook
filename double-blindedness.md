# Double-blindedness

This is how double-blind policy is implemented in the PCS System used at NIME: 

1. authors do not know external reviewer nor meta-reviewer names   
2. external reviewers do not know author names   
3. meta-reviewers know both author and external reviewer names  
4.  external reviewers do not know other external reviewer names   
5. external reviewers know meta-reviewer names

The only strictly double-blind part is that between external reviewers and authors.
