## During the conference


## After the conference

The installation chair is responsible for making documentation available after the conference. 

### Prepare Artistic Proceedings

Starting from 2020, Artistic Proceedings include extended abstracts describing aesthetic and techncial features of the accepted installations and music pieces. The installation chair should work in tandem with the music chair to prepare the artistic proceedings. 

In order for these to be archived and made openly available on Zenodo and nime.org, files should be prepared as follows:

- a folder with PDFs named using the following naming convention: nimeYYYY_installation###.pdf, where YYYY are the four digits of the year and ### the number of the extended abstract (e.g. nime2019_installation123.pdf);
- a bibtex file with pointers to the PDF file in the nime.org URL in the bibtex URL field, e.g. :
```
URL ={http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2019/nime2019_installation123.pdf} 
```
