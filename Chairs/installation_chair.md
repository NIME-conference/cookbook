# Installation Chair

Main role: Be responsible for the installation program during the conference. This includes:

1. Direct the music reviewing/selection process
2. Make the installation program
3. Be responsible for running the installations during the conference
4. Prepare the archival of the [installation proceedings](https://github.com/NIME-conference/NIME-bibliography/tree/master/installation_proceedings)

The Paper Chair will work closely with the [Music Archive Officer](../Officers/music_proceedings.md).

## Before the conference

In 2020 NIME was delivered online due to the Covid pandemic. In this "experiment" the NIME community got to experience first hand a remote event and analysed which aspects of this are feasible and to keep for future NIMEs, and which aren't. For this reason, before the conference there should be an in-depth discussion wether installations are meant to be solely physical and in loco, or if the NIME organising team is willing to set-up a support system for authors to submit remote installations. If so, this needs to be made clear and (I personally suggest) two separate categories are made: local installations and online installations.

### Proposal requirements

The following information should be included in the proposal for local installations:

* Title of the work
* Names and short bios of contributing artists
* description
* installation
* setup time (this is required when scheduling to estimate the time needed between installations)
* setup space requirements
* description of experience
* experience duration
* audience roles
* level of completion (i.e. is it an idea? has it been experimented? in refinement stages? completed?)
* diagrams of the installation
* video demos

The following information should be included in the proposal for online installations:

* Title of the work
* Names and short bios of contributing artists
* description
* technical description
* Proof of feasibility // link to prototype // references of previous similar work
* Link to audio-visual documentation
* description of experience
* experience duration
* audience roles
* Access requirements

### Assessment criteria

Rate each along the following dimensions:

1. level of interactivity
2. artistic merit
3. technical novelty
4. feasibility
5. engagement factor



## During the conference

During the conference the installation chairs are prompted to make sure that the installations run smoothly. In terms of the online installations this would also require reminding attendees of the existance of online installations that don't have the luxury of being in the physical space of the conference.

## After the conference

The installation chair is responsible for making documentation available after the conference.

### Prepare Artistic Proceedings

Starting from 2020, Artistic Proceedings include extended abstracts describing aesthetic and technical features of the accepted installations and music pieces. The installation chair should work in tandem with the music chair to prepare the artistic proceedings.

In order for these to be archived and made openly available on Zenodo and nime.org, files should be prepared as follows:

- a folder with PDFs named using the following naming convention: nimeYYYY_installation###.pdf, where YYYY are the four digits of the year and ### the number of the extended abstract (e.g. nime2019_installation123.pdf);
- a bibtex file with pointers to the PDF file in the nime.org URL in the bibtex URL field, e.g. :
```
URL ={http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2019/nime2019_installation123.pdf}
```
