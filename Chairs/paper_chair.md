# Paper Chair

Main role: Be responsible for the scientific program during the conference. This includes:

1. Directing the paper reviewing and selection process
2. Making the presentation/poster/demo program
3. Preparing the proceedings for archival

The Paper Chair will work closely with the [Paper Archive Officer](../Officers/paper_proceedings.md).

## Before the conference


### Prepare Call for participation (September)

The CFP is usually adjusted slightly from year to year, but not be drastically different. Please refer to [previous calls](../calls/cfp2012.md).


### Set up the Conference Management System (November)

NIME used Easyconf as the Conference Management System (CMS) for many years. After some bad experiences with server crashes, lack of support, and lack of multi-track functionality, we decided to move away. From 2012 NIME has been using Precision Conference as CMS. Chairs have reported this to be a solid system, although with some of a learning curve. It is also quite costly.

In 2019 the SC has decided to switch to a different system. The discussion revealed that there are two main options:

- EasyConf
- Microsoft Conference Management Toolkit

The former is used by SMC, MOCO (and many others). The latter is used by ISMIR, WAC (and many others). I don't have a strong opinion on which one to use. For the SC the most important is not to change every year. So if we decide on something we should stay with it for a few years.

### Recruit reviewers (December)

* When it comes to reviewers, you can get lists from previous chairs (or it may be in the system). It is common to add some local people each year, and some of these should probably be removed if they are not regular NIMErs.

* Be careful about accepting to take on reviewers that start out saying they have little time, and can do the reviews a bit late. If people first start being late, they may be vary late, or not deliver at all. It is a very tight

* Be very strict about deadlines, and plan well ahead. The reviewer pool should be ready way before the deadline, preferably before Christmas. It is better to get too many than too few.

* Prepare reviewers and meta-reviewers about what is coming when. So a week before they should get to action, you can send them an e-mail and inform them about when they will receive their assignments.


### Peer review (February)

This is the most critical phase for the paper chair(s), since time is limited and the pressure is high. It helps the process a lot if reviewers have been recruited early on. Please also be very precise in your communication, with clear deadlines and expectancy for everyone involved.

* The paper chair(s) assign papers to reviewers (3-4 per paper to get enough) and follow up the deadlines
* A group of meta-reviewers write the summaries and suggest acceptance
* The paper chair(s) do the final selection

#### Distribution of reviews

In the interest of running the process as smoothly as possible, the paper chair(s) should do the review assignment and follow-up. This is how it has always been (we only started with meta-reviewers in 2014). The CMS helps out a lot by coming up with suggestions of reviewers based on expertise. Having a centralized reviewer assignment also helps in avoiding individuals to be contacted by multiple meta-reviewers.

It is important to avoid an uneven distribution of reviews (some reviewers with many reviews, and some reviewers with none). You should aim for a better distribution of papers to the community of reviewers by distributing at least one paper for each reviewer. This also involves the community more broadly, and helps get new and young people on board early in their careers.

To ensure better fit with reviewers, you should promote adding sample papers to the CMS profile, and also open for bidding for papers.

#### Meta-reviewers

NIME has been using meta-reviewers since 2014. This has helped improve the general quality of reviews. Meta-reviewers have been responsible for 5-15 papers. Obviously, the quality of the work goes up with fewer papers, but having more meta-reviewers also makes the whole process more vulnerable if they do not deliver. It is important to get a reliable list of meta-reviewers from previous chairs.

A general problem is that there are different levels of meta-reviews. It is unclear if meta-reviewers sometimes rely only on the external reviewer's reviews, and not on her/his reading of the paper. A serious risk is reviewers having a wrong impression and ultimately biasing the meta-reviewer. Ideally each meta-reviewer should have fewer submissions, so that they can do a proper reading of the papers themselves.


### Test print the proceedings

We are not printing the NIME proceedings for the conferences any longer. Please remember that many people still print individual papers, so it is advisable to test print all papers to check if any errors occur.


### Confirmation letter to send

After paper reviewing there are different kinds of letter to send:
* submitted and accepted as paper
* submitted as paper but downgraded to poster
* submitted as poster and accepted as such
* submitted as concert but performed as club
* submitted as concert but downgraded to demo


### Double-blindedness

This is how double-blind policy is implemented in the PCS System used at NIME:

1. authors do not know external reviewer nor meta-reviewer names   
2. external reviewers do not know author names   
3. meta-reviewers know both author and external reviewer names  
4. external reviewers do not know other external reviewer names   
5. external reviewers know meta-reviewer names

The only strictly double-blind part is that between external reviewers and authors.

A few number of poorly anonymized submissions that were detected were "rescued" by asking the authors to submit a corrected manuscript and redistribute it to new external reviewers, which was a hard task (meta-reviewers could be kept because they are able to see the author names of the submissions). We recommend to check if papers are properly anonymized before distributing them among reviewers.

- Anonymization: The templates are anonymized with seemingly real names. It is not the first time that this creates confusion among reviewers and even meta-reviewers. Often times, the anonymization is so strict that it is very difficult to get the full picture. It is very important to take the anonymization policy seriously otherwise some authors will be better positioned than others. We recommend offering solutions / options to the authors so that they can still upload videos, datasets, links, etc to improved the reviewing experience.

### Lessons learned in 2019




- Conflict of interest policy taken seriously: We decided to remove two reviews that had conflict of interests. We recommend to keep this issue seriously by following the NIME statements published online.
A master list of NIME reviewers: The list of reviewers and meta-reviewers seems to change year over year, and it is unclear whether there is a master list where all the community is included. We recommend to have a master list of NIME reviewers and meta-reviewers that just adds / sums the new names every year and has a field of status (e.g. not available this year, etc).


- Tentative reviewers: We had a number of reviewers who did not reply / were tentative. With the aim of getting 3 reviews per submission and helping the meta-reviewers, we send out more invitations, and once we achieved the quota, we deleted the tentative reviewers. It turned that some of the reviewers were having an independent conversation with the meta-reviewer, and perhaps agreed using another medium (e.g. email). We recommend that it is OK to leave tentative reviewers hanging in the system even after inviting new reviewers. This may have a double advantage: on the one hand we can't really know in advance if tentative reviewers will eventually respond nor if accepted reviewers will in fact comply with their promises, so the worst-case scenario for having 5 or 6 external reviewers with some "pending" is to end up with a few extra reviews for a few papers; on the other hand, by leaving them hanging in the system, by the end of the reviewing period we would have a clear picture of the "unreliable reviewers", maybe to serve as a heads-up for the next chairs (sort of a blacklist).

- Removing reviewers: For each submission, the system is unclear with reviewers who are removed for any particular reason (reassignment due to lack of anonymisation, unresponsiveness, busy, etc).  We recommend to have some kind of history and be able to see for each submission 1) who has been already invited to be a reviewer and removed (and the reason why, e.g. lack of anonymity, unresponsiveness, busy), and 2) who has declined the invitation already. This would not apply if we keep the tentative reviewers as suggested in the previous point.

- Gender parity (and also diversity): It should be addressed at all parts of the organization, and also at all times, including the actual realization of the conference. It is important to encourage the community to reflect on the importance of these matters in order to deepen the awareness that simply reducing it to numbers (e.g. striving to include as many women as men) is worthless if not accompanied by the acknowledgement of the importance of each individual's contribution. It is also important to promote actions that strive to create equal opportunities to all participants by compensating unforeseen biases.





## During the conference

### Presentation duration

Previously there was a difference in presentation time between short and long papers. That has changed, and all presentations are now equally long.

There have been different duration of the talks, but they generally follow this pattern:

* 10-15 min presentation + 3 min questions + 2 min turnover

Remember to inform presenters about the duration of talks every time you have the chance, since people tend to forget.


### Running paper sessions

Time is short, so it is important to have a structured approach to chairing the oral sessions.
The paper chair needs to find session chairs to run each session. It is common to use experienced participants as session chairs, but please also consider giving new people a chance (and remember the diversity also of session chairs).

It is important that the paper chair clearly informs the session chairs about their duties:

- Arrive early to the session, and welcome all presenters.
- Ask presenters to test their setup before their session.
- Start on time, every minute matters. Remember to close the doors.
- Keep track of the time, and signal to presenters when there are 5, 2, 0 minutes left.
- Ask next presenters to set up during the Q&A session.

Please also ensure that you have volunteers available to assist during the session. Ideally you will have one volunteer helping with the audiovisual setup, and at least one volunteer to run with microphones during Q&A sessions.

Remember that session chairs do a very important job during the conference! An important part of the job is to smile, breath, and help nervous presenters to relax. But it is equally important to keep the time, nobody likes to be delayed to a coffee break.


### No-shows

We do not accept remote presentation, video presentation, or presentations by non-authors at NIME conferences. The reason for this is that the conference should not only be a place for publishing papers (then a journal is more appropriate), but be a meeting point of people. That is not possible if the authors are not present. No-shows happen, for various reasons, but it should be discouraged. The most efficient way of doing this, is to remove no-show papers from the proceedings.

This rule was created after seeing a number of cases in which people would submit their work, get it accepted, and not show up to present it at the conference (usually last minute or not even without notice). This is unfortunate for the participants, because it creates "holes" in the program, and it prevents other papers from being accepted for presentation. In addition it undermines the idea of the conference as a meeting point and a venue for active discussion.

We do realize that this rule may seem unnecessarily strict, but we also see that it would be very difficult to come up with another rule that does not have a number of unintended side-effects.

For people that have been accepted for one conference but that could not make it, we have allowed for the paper to be presented at the next conference without a new submission/reviewing process. Please do consider this option.




## After the conference


### Getting the proceedings on NIME.org

The nime.org archive is built on [BibTeX files](https://github.com/NIME-conference/NIME-bibliography) stored at Github. As paper chair it is your job to prepare a complete BibTeX file adhering to the NIME standards. The steps involved in this is as follows.

#### Remove papers that were not presented

There are always some accepted papers that are not presented for various reasons. No matter the reason, papers that are not presented at the conference should be removed from the proceedings. This is because the proceedings should reflect what actually happened at the conference. It is also very important to let all (future) authors know that NIME has a strict no-show procedure.

#### Fix errors in the metadata or papers

Due to the short time in preparing the proceedings before the conference, there may be occasional errors in metadata (author names, affiliations, etc.) or in the PDF files (most often wrong page layout, missing fonts, low-resolution images, etc.).

It is in NIME's interest to have as good metadata and PDFs as possible, so we do accept such error corrections and minor PDF modifications.

#### Export from PrecisionConf

When the basic "post-processing" of the proceedings is done, it is time to generate the BibTeX file. As of 2018 it should be possible to export BibTeX directly from Precision Conference. Prior to that we had to do some post-processing with the script [Precision2BibTeX](https://github.com/NIME-conference/Precision2BibTeX).


#### Massaging the BibTeX file

The exported BibTeX file need some "massaging" to match the other BibTeX files in the repository. Please check the [files on Github](https://github.com/NIME-conference/NIME-bibliography/tree/master/BibTeX) to see how the file shold be formatted. Typically this includes:

- Check the title of the proceedings. It should be the generic title "Proceedings of the international conference on new interfaces for musical expression". The year and place should be included in separate fields, not as part of the title. This is because the ISSN for the series is bound to the generic proceedings title.
- Check that abstracts are included for all papers. Please also check that there are no line-breaks in the abstracts.
- Check weird formatting (typically unicode-related issues). Can be done automatically using for example JabRef or [bibclean](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/bibclean.1.html)
- Insert ISSN number (and possibly ISBN) in each post (query-replace usually works fine)
- Insert right link to PDFs. Should be something like nime20XX_ID.pdf.


#### Send the material to the paper proceedings officer

The NIME paper proceedings officer will help with the above, and will also do the final upload to nime.org.
