# Music Chair


## Before the conference


### Create call for participation

Here you should collaborate with the other chairs. NIME particularly supports submitting both artistic and scientific contributions ("Paper+Performance").

For the call it may be particularly good to plan if you are able to provide performers/ensembles or special equipment/rooms.


### Peer review

Peer reviewing is an important part of the music submission process. The general experience is that it is more difficult to recruit reviewers for the music submissions, and the quality of reviews are also much more variable than for paper submissions. It is therefore important that the music chair is in control of the process. 


## During the conference

The most important role of the music chair is to keep track of rehearsals during day time and concerts at night.


### Documentation

It is important to prepare good documentation of the events, in the form of high-quality audio and video recordings, as well as pictures.


## After the conference



### Prepare music documentation

The media recorded during the conference needs to be edited and made available.

### Prepare music Proceedings

As of 2019, the music proceedings are made openly available. In order for these to be made available on Zenodo and nime.org

- a folder with PDFs named using the following naming convention: nimeYYYY_music###.pdf, where YYYY are the four digits of the year and ### the number of the extended abstract (e.g. nime2019_music123.pdf);
- a bibtex file with pointers to the PDF file in the nime.org URL in the bibtex URL field (e.g. URL = {http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2019/nime2019_music123.pdf}.
