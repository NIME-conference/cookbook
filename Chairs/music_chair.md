# Music Chair


## Before the conference


### Create call for participation

Here you should collaborate with the other chairs. NIME particularly supports submitting both artistic and scientific contributions ("Paper+Performance").

For the call it may be particularly good to plan if you are able to provide performers/ensembles or special equipment/rooms.


### Peer review

Peer reviewing is an important part of the music submission process. The general experience is that it is more difficult to recruit reviewers for the music submissions, and the quality of reviews is also much more variable than for paper submissions. It is therefore important that the music chair is in control of the process. In case the reviewing process for a submission results problematic (e.g. highly polarised reviews, program committee members strongly disagreeing or rising concerns) the music chair should moderate the discussion and consider asking the authors to provide a rebuttal and/or additional information in order to clarify and resolve the issue. 

## During the conference

The most important role of the music chair is to keep track of rehearsals during day time and concerts at night. It is advisable to compile all the technical requirements of the pieces included in the program in a single spreadsheet and share this information with the tech crew in order to make sure that all the equipment is available before the beginning of the conference. 


### Documentation

It is important to prepare good documentation of the events, in the form of high-quality audio and video recordings, as well as pictures.


## After the conference



### Prepare music documentation

The media recorded during the conference needs to be edited and made available.

### Prepare Music/Artistic Proceedings

As of 2019, the music proceedings are made openly available in the form of extended abstracts describing the aesthetic and techncial features of the pieces. 

In order for these to be archived and made available on Zenodo and nime.org, files should be prepared as follows:

- a folder with PDFs named using the following naming convention: nimeYYYY_music###.pdf, where YYYY are the four digits of the year and ### the number of the extended abstract (e.g. nime2019_music123.pdf);
- a bibtex file with pointers to the PDF file in the nime.org URL in the bibtex URL field, e.g. :
```
URL ={http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2019/nime2019_music123.pdf} 
```
Starting from 2020, music proceedings are part of the artistic proceedings, which also include extended abstracts describing the accepted installations.
