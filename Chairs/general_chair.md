# General Chair


## Before the conference

### Accommodation

Many NIME participants are traveling on a budget, so it would be good to come up with suggested accommodation alternatives in the lower price end. This can include anything from university student housing to cheap hotels.

To allow participants to suggest accommodation and/or to contact each other about sharing apartments, etc., it may be useful to set up some kind of e-mail list or web forum (e.g. on Facebook). It is better to leave the NIME.org mailing list for general announcements.


### Copyright and GDPR documents

To be able to record presentations and performances, remember to include consent forms regarding GDPR and copyright.


## During the conference

The most important role of the general chair is to act as a host. You should not plan to do anything in particular, nor be responsible for anything. You will be swamped by all sorts of questions anyways, and should have extra time to just talk to people, talk to journalists, etc.


## After the conference

### Report to the SC

The conference organizer should at the end of the conference prepare an evaluation report for the steering committee. This evaluation report is mainly going to discuss various issues that can be valuable for future organizers. This may include:

* practical matters:
** economy
** web page
** conference management system

* content:
** paper/music selection
** conference profile

The most important is to understand what went well, and what can be improved.
